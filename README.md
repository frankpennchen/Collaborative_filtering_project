# Collaborative Filtering 
This project is to develop user-based, item-based neighborhood methods and matrix factorization algorithms for collaborative filtering using one of the MovieLens data set. I use MovieLens Latest Datasets Small: 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users.
